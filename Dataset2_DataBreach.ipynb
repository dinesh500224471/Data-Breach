Inn, says it is investigating claims of a possible credit card breach at some U.S. locations.Last week, KrebsOnSecurity began hearing from sources who work in fraud prevention at different financial institutions. Those sources said they were seeing a pattern of fraud on customer credit and debit cards that suggested a breach at some IHG properties \\u2014 particularly Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express locations.Asked about the fraud patterns reported by my sources, a spokesperson for IHG said the company had received similar reports, and that it has hired an outside security firm to help investigate. IHG also issued the following statement:\\u201cIHG takes the protection of payment card data very seriously.\\u00a0We were made aware of a report of unauthorized charges occurring on some payment cards that were recently used at a small number of U.S.-based hotel locations. \\u00a0We immediately launched an investigation, which includes retaining a leading computer security firm to provide us with additional support.\\u00a0\\u00a0We continue to work with the payment card networks.\\u201d\\u201cWe are\\u00a0committed to\\u00a0swiftly resolving\\u00a0this\\u00a0matter.\\u00a0In the meantime, and in line with best practice, we recommend that individuals closely monitor their payment card account statements.\\u00a0\\u00a0If there are unauthorized charges, individuals should immediately notify their bank. Payment card network rules generally state that cardholders are not responsible for such charges.\\u201dHeadquartered in Denham, U.K., IHG operates more than 5,000 hotels across nearly 100 countries.

But in an update late Monday, DocuSign confirmed that this malicious third party was able to send the messages to customers and users because it had broken in and stolen DocuSign\\u2019s list of customers and users.\\u201cAs part of our ongoing investigation, today we confirmed that a malicious third party had gained temporary access to a separate, non-core system that allows us to communicate service-related announcements to users via email,\\u201d DocuSign wrote in an alert posted to its site. \\u201cA complete forensic analysis has confirmed that only email addresses were accessed; no names, physical addresses, passwords, social security numbers, credit card data or other information was accessed. No content or any customer documents sent through DocuSign\\u2019s eSignature system was accessed; and DocuSign\\u2019s core eSignature service, envelopes and customer documents and data remain secure.\\u201dThe company is asking people to forward any suspicious emails related to DocuSign to spam@docusign.com, and then to delete the missives.\\u00a0\\u201cThey may appear suspicious because you don\\u2019t recognize the sender, weren\\u2019t expecting a document to sign, contain misspellings (like \\u201cdocusgn.com\\u201d without an \\u2018i\\u2019 or @docus.com), contain an attachment, or direct you to a link that starts with anything other than https://www.docusign.com or https://www.docusign.net,\\u201d reads the advisory.If you have reason to expect a DocuSign document via email, don\\u2019t respond to an email that looks like it\\u2019s from DocuSign by clicking a link in the message. When in doubt, access your documents directly by visiting docusign.com, and entering the unique security code included at the bottom of every legitimate DocuSign email. DocuSign says it will never ask recipients to open a PDF, Office document or ZIP file in an email.DocuSign was already a perennial target for phishers and malware writers, but this incident is likely to intensify attacks against its users and customers. DocuSign says it has more than 100 million users, and it seems all but certain that the criminals who stole the company\\u2019s customer email list are going to be putting it to nefarious use for some time to come.\\\"\", \"Information Source\": \"Krebs On Security\", \"Source URL\": \"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/05/breach-at-docusign-led-to-targeted-email-malware-campaign/\", \"Year of Breach\": 2017, \"Latitude\": 37.77493, \"Longitude\": -122.419416, \"text\": \" docusign major provider ofelectronic signature technology acknowledged today series recent malware phishingattacks targeting customers users result data breach one computer systems the company stresses data stolen limited customer user email addresses incident especially dangerous allows attackers target users may already expecting click links emails docusign san francisco based docusign warned may tracking malicious email campaign subject line reads completed docusign com wire transfer instructions recipient name document ready signature missives contained link downloadable microsoft word document harbored malware the company said time messages associated docusign sent malicious third party using docusign branding headers body email update late monday docusign confirmed malicious third party able send messages customers users broken stolen docusigns list customers users as part ongoing investigation today confirmed malicious third party gained temporary access separate non core system allows us communicate service related announcements users via email docusign wrote alert posted site a complete forensic analysis confirmed email addresses accessed names physical addresses passwords social security numbers credit card data information accessed content customer documents sent docusigns esignature system accessed docusigns core esignature service envelopes customer documents data remain secure the company asking people forward suspicious emails related docusign spam delete missives they may appear suspicious dont recognize sender werent expecting document sign contain misspellings like docusgn com without i contain attachment direct link starts anything reads advisory if reason expect docusign document via email dont respond email looks like its docusign clicking link message doubt access documents directly visiting docusign com entering unique security code included bottom every legitimate docusign email docusign says never ask recipients open pdf office document zip file email docusign already perennial target phishers malware writers incident likely intensify attacks users customers docusign says million users seems certain criminals stole companys customer email list going putting nefarious use time come \"}, {\"Date Made Public\": \"5/17/2017\", \"Company\": \"Sabre Corporation\", \"City\": \"Southlake\", \"State\": \"Texas\", \"Type of breach\": \"HACK\", \"Type of organization\": \"BSO\", \"Total Records\": \"0\", \"Description of incident\": \"\\\"Breaches involving major players in the hospitality industry continue to pile up.

In that story I mentioned True Health was one of three major healthcare providers with similar website problems, and that the other two providers didn\\u2019t even require a login to view all patient records. Today we\\u2019ll examine a flaw that was just fixed by Molina Healthcare, a Fortune 500 company that until recently was exposing countless patient medical claims to the entire Internet without requiring any authentication.In April 2017 I received an anonymous tip from a reader who said he\\u2019d figured out that just by changing a single number in the Web address\\u00a0when accessing his recent medical claim at MolinaHealthcare.com he could then view any and all other patient claims.More alarmingly, the link he was given to access his claim with Molina was accessible to anyone who had the link; no authentication was required to view it. Nor was any authentication required to view any other records that could be accessed by fiddling with the numbers after the bit at the end of Molinahealthcare.com address (e.g., claimID=123456789).In other words, having access to a single hyperlink to a patient record would allow an attacker to enumerate and download all other claims. The source showed me screenshots of his medical records at Molina, and how when he changed a single number in the URL it happily displayed another patient\\u2019s records.The records did not appear to include Social Security numbers, but they do include patient names, addresses and dates of birth, as well as potentially sensitive information that may point to specific diseases, such as medical procedure codes and any prescribed medications.I contacted Molina about the issue, and the company released a brief statement saying it had fixed the problem. Molina also said it was trying to figure out how such a mistake was made, and if there was any evidence to suggest the Web site bug had been widely abused.\\u201cThe previously identified security issue has been remediated,\\u201d the company said. \\u201cBecause protecting our members\\u2019 information is of utmost importance to Molina and out of an abundance of caution, we are taking our ePortal temporarily offline to perform additional testing of our system security.
